![Simon Childs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/me.jpg){: .profile}

I am Simon Childs. I am tech lead for a rapidly growing [FinTech](http://www.ndrc.ie/2014/03/fintech/) company based in Cardiff. I spend most of my days writting code and solving problems.

I am passionate about technology, motorsport, my wife [Lauren](https://www.pinterest.com/lozchilds/) and my cat. I live just outside of Cardiff in a peaceful little village called Taffs Well.
