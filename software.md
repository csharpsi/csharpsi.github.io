I call my self a "Software Developer". A lot of developers will call themselves a ".NET developer" or a "PHP developer", but I don't believe in being pigeonholed into one particular language. I like to think of myself as a "Multi-lingual software developer", but like people who are actually multi-lingual, I am more fluent at some languages than others. Below is a list of the languages I am currently able to "speak":

* C#.NET Framework 3.5 => 4.5
* Javascript (including node.js and angular.js)
* HTML(5)
* CSS(3) / LESS / SCSS
* Powershell
* PHP
