Before I start, I should mention straight away that the solution I propose here is **not free**. This post is mostly intended for those of you lucky enough to work in a company that is willing and able to spend cash on tech.

Displaying PDF files in a browser has long been a tricky thing to do, especially if you take into account cross browser compatibility. The first thing you might think of doing is putting an  
`<iframe href="/some.pdf">` into your page and forgetting about it, right? Well, no. Not really.

The PDF will render differently in every browser, and if you don't have [Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://acrobat.adobe.com/uk/en/products/pdf-reader.html) installed, you won't see anything.

This can be problematic when your design team have produced a beautiful layout allowing users to upload PDF files and have a preview of their uploaded file displayed to them in the browser, with beautiful sticker type styles laid over the file and no controls what so ever. Not such an easy task now.

This is where [Apitron PDF Rasterizer](http://apitron.com/Product/pdf-rasterizer) comes in. As I said at the begining of this post, this is not a free option. It is, however, a fantasic piece of software.
