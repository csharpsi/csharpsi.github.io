> It always seems impossible until it's done


That quote from Nelson Mandela is a bit of a meme at my office. Partly because it's a great sentance said by a great man, but mainly because I'm infamous for proclaiming that some of the ideas (of which there are *many*) my CEO comes up with are **impossible!** and **can't be done**, only to later develop a solution within "5 minutes" (or so goes the meme).

This is one of the *many* things I am learning to deal with at work and in my personal life - nothing is impossible, if you haven't tried to do it yet. Let me give you a practical example:

We had a requirment to allow users to upload PDF files and have that file displayed to them as a preview in the browser. On the surface to people who don't know the ins and outs of cross browser compatability, this seems like a simple and reasonable requirment. To me, at the time at least, this was the end of the world. So much so, that I managed to convince our UX designer to rethink. A regrettable decision on my part.

Since then, one of my collegues Shawn did some research and found [Apitron](http://www.apitron.com/), which we have since been able to implement in another part of the system to render PDF files as individual PNG images for each page. *Very* cool. I will go into the details of I implemented Apitron in a later post, but suffice it to say, it has made the system appear to the end user as though it is a simple and slick process. Which is what really matters.

####Conclusion

Saying that there is no possible solution to a given problem (sorry, *"opportunity"*) is, in essence, a little ignorate. In software, there is generally *always* at least one way to achieve something. It may not always be the most eligant or "pretty" solution, but hey - if it works, who gives a f@\*k
